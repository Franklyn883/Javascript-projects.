# JavaScript Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to honing my JavaScript skills through a series of progressively challenging exercises. Each challenge is designed to focus on specific aspects of object-oriented programming, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to facilitate structured practice and learning. By taking on increasingly complex challenges, I aim to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and object-oriented programming principles.
